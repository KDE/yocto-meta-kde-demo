# Docker build environment

This is an attempt to isolate the yocto build from variations in the host system.

This is full of assumptions about my specific setup, so use with care!

## Build docker image

docker build -t vkrause/yocto .

## Use docker image

docker run -it --rm -v /k/yocto/src/:/yocto vkrause/yocto
